# Random Quote Generator
 
This project generates a random quote and random color from a static object. The quote changes every 20 seconds and if the "Show another quote button is pushed" it will change the quote immediately. 

<em>It was initially written in ES5 and updated to ES6.</em>

<strong>This project demonstrates understanding of:</strong>
<ul>
 <li>Creating functions</li>
 <li>Creating objects and calling their properties</li>
 <li>The Math.floor and Math.random methods</li>
 <li>The setInterval function</li>
